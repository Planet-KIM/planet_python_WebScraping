2020-03-29 14:58:00,"For the political term, see Benevolent dictatorship.Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) is a title given to a small number of open-source software development leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language.[1][2] Shortly after Van Rossum joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by Ken Manheimer to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".[1] Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.[3]BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by Eric S. Raymond's essay ""Homesteading the Noosphere"" (1999).[4] Among other topics related to hacker culture, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the forking of the project under the rule of new leaders.

2020-02-29 06:52:00,"  A timeline chart of how Linux distributions have forked.In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.[1]Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g.Unix) also happen.

2020-03-22 00:42:00,"""Homesteading the Noosphere"" (abbreviated HtN) is an essay written by Eric S. Raymond about the social workings of open-sourcesoftware development. It follows his previous piece ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" (1997).
The essay examines issues of project ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible anthropological roots of the gift culture in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of closed source software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the noosphere, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.
Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the open source movement. He seems to settle on the idea that open source practitioners find striving for a great reputation within the ""tribe"" a key motivational feature.

(September 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In computing, the sticky bit is a user ownership access rightflag that can be assigned to files and directories on Unix-like systems.
When a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or delete the file. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. Typically this is set on the /tmp directory to prevent ordinary users from deleting or moving other users' files.
The modern function of the sticky bit was introduced in 4.3BSD[discuss]",Sticky bit,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit
2020-02-04 12:40:00,"Allowed actions in file systemsMost file systems have methods to assign permissions or access rights to specific users and groups of users.  These permissions control the ability of the users to view, change, navigate, and execute the contents of the file system. In some cases, menu options or functions may be made visible or hidden depending on a user's permission level; this kind of user interface is referred to as permission-driven.
Two types of permissions are very widely used: traditional Unix permissions date back many decades to the earliest days of Unix.  They are universally available on all Unix and Linux derived platforms. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are more recent in origin and are universally used on Microsoft Windows based file systems where the file system supports user permissions (mainly NTFS and ReFS), and are also now commonly used and widely available in most common Unix and Linux based systems, although not necessarily all. They are generally capable of far more detailed fine-tuning of permissions than the traditional Unix permissions, and permit a system of access control which traditional ACLs cannot provide. On Unix and Linux based systems, the standard type of ACL is that defined by the POSIX standard (POSIX ACLs) but other variants exist such as NFS v3 and v4 ACLs, which work slightly differently (NFSv3 ACLs or NFSv4 ACLs). 
Where multiple systems are available within the same operating system, there is usually a way to specify which will be used for any given file system, and how the system should handle attempts to access or modify permissions that are controlled by one of these, using commands designed for another. The usual solution is to ensure at least some degree of awareness and inter-operability between the different commands and methods.

The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language.[1][2] Shortly after Van Rossum joined the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by Ken Manheimer to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".[1] Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python.[3]BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by Eric S. Raymond's essay ""Homesteading the Noosphere"" (1999).[4] Among other topics related to hacker culture, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the forking of the project under the rule of new leaders.

2020-01-02 21:10:00,"The Linux Kongress was an annual conference of Linux developers from around the world, that took place every year from 1994 to 2010. It started as a two-day conference in 1994, when Linux was in the early stages of development, and by 2003 had become a four-day event. It occurred every year in Germany except 2001 and 2007. During its lifespan, Linux-Kongress was one of the three major international grass-roots Linux and Open Source conferences in the world, along with linux.conf.au and Ottawa Linux Symposium.
The focus of Linux-Kongress was development topics, either in kernel or user space. The conference language was English. By the end, the event consisted of two days of conference preceded by two days of tutorials.
Notable speakers[edit]The conference was a meeting place for many different types of developers. Speakers at the conference included kernel developers like Linus Torvalds, Alan Cox, Theodore Ts'o, Rusty Russell, James Bottomley, user space developers like Kalle Dalheimer and Miguel de Icaza, and open source advocates like Eric S. Raymond and Jon Hall.
History[edit]In 1999 the conference cooperated with the Storage Management Workshop. In 2000 and 2001 there were several multi-day workshops sponsored by the German Ministry of Science and Education that preceded the conference. Also there was collaboration with NLUUG. In 2009 it was co-located with the OpenSolaris Developer Conference OSDevCon.

He was fiercely anticlerical, perhaps an atheist, and his early writings against Roman Catholic Church in Mexico gained him a reputation as an articulate liberal ideologue.[1] Ocampo has been considered the heir to José María Luis Mora, the premier liberal intellectual of the early republic.[2] He served in the administration of Benito Juárez and negotiated a controversial agreement with the United States, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty.  The Mexican state where his hometown of Maravatío now stands was much later renamed Michoacán de Ocampo in his honor.

Presumably the declaration was orchestrated by President Antonio López de Santa Anna in agreement with the high clergy.
After the triumph of the Plan of Cuernavaca, all laws enacted by the progressives during ten months in office were repealed, 
the Pontifical and National University of Mexico was reopened, Congress was dissolved and the officials who implemented the reform measures were dismissed. 
Santa Anna's first dictatorship began.

In Mexico the new constitution was rejected by a large part of society, which had the support of the clergy and the army. Comonfort, aware of the limitations imposed by the new regime, proposed reforms to strengthen the government and mitigate ""radical"" measures; however, Congress rejected them. Given the delicate situation, Félix Zuloaga and other generals convinced Comonfort to convene another congress to draft a new constitution more in keeping with the customs of the nation. On December 17, 1857, Zuloaga proclaimed the Plan of Tacubaya. Comonfort joined the Plan of Tacubaya, which began the three-year war.[1]Contents1",Plan of Tacubaya,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_of_Tacubaya

It is largely characterized by a special combination of coverage mainly based on the employment status of the people and secondarily, based on the capacity of affording external health insurance.[1]The Mexican Federal Constitution places main responsibility on the state in providing national health to the population. [2] Public healthcare is accomplished by an elaborate segmented provisioning and delivery system, which was put in place by the federal government of Mexico around 70 years ago. This segmentation in the system has allowed private organizations and offices run by physicians to offer a variety of healthcare options to people who can afford it and are willing to pay for it. [3] The overall structure of the Mexican health system is in a continually developing and heterogenous state, and this is reflected in national health statistics and accessibility standards observed in the country.

It is about the life of writer Charles 'Chub' Fuller, who while attending Oberlin College from 1968 to 1972 channels his childhood experiences as the only child of an alcoholic, suicidal father and a moody, impossible-to-please mother into a series of short stories, shared only with his friend and foil Stanley 'Two-Brew' Kitchel.[1]The book was one of Goldman's most autobiographical novels.[2]Plot[edit]The first time Chub gets the impulse to write, he has witnessed a fight between the girl of his dreams, B.J. Peacock, and her boyfriend Del that centers on a man knowing he'll never be able to make his woman happy, but that he'll never be able not to try.  Two-Brew is a harsh critic, but feels Chub has the gift—his highest praise for anything Chub has written are four words: ""on to the next""—implying that he wants to read more of Chub's work.  Two-Brew's father runs Sutton Press in New York, and Chub's first long-awaited visit to New York City is punctuated with the surprise that Two-Brew's father has agreed to publish Chub's first short story.
Chub's writing continues, usually after a collision of an emotional experience in his daily life with a childhood memory, and results in a series of short stories.  Over one Christmas break, he visits his mother to surprise her with his published short story, but she sees herself portrayed negatively and explodes.  Chub leaves almost as soon as he arrives, and returns to the Oberlin dorm with weeks of Christmas break ahead of him and nothing to do but write.  He births a long story about his father's rise, fall and suicide—the best story he's written, Chub thinks—but Two-Brew insists that it's wrong for a short story and should be a novel.  Chub's writing continues, but his focus on his studies suffers, and he graduates jobless.  He works at a bar the summer after graduation when Two-Brew, now a young executive in his father's publishing house, suggests Chub connect his short stories and pitch them as a book, as a prelude to the novel about his father.  Chub agrees immediately, but Two-Brew has already made the pitch.  He hands Chub an envelope with two advance checks, and Chub moves to New York to write his novel.
The book of short stories is published as Under the Weather, and is a modest hit.  While Chub enjoys the praise, his walkup flat and New York life in general, he simply isn't writing.  He is distracted by illness, and the return of B.J. Peacock into his life, now divorced with a young daughter Jesse, and aware that she inspired Chub's first story.  They fall in love, marry and Chub is blissfully happy as both husband and father.  However, B.J.'s jealousy extends to his relationship with Jesse, and during a Hawaii trip designed to recapture their happiness, Jesse is drowned by a rogue wave while in Chub's care, which leads to divorce, and a long, dark period for Chub.  He teaches at his old school and is terrorized by a student he reported for plagiarism.
Years pass.  Chub lives in New York doing research for other writers, paralyzed by the incandescent emotion of his father's suicide, Jesse's death and his divorce.  At a party for Two-Brew celebrating his ascension to head of the publishing company, he meets Bonita Kraus (""The Bone""), a tall, intense ex-model with aspirations of writing in the genre of Trash.  Two wounded people, they share intimacy of a sort, but only when Sandy Smith, a nubile young fan of Under the Weather shows up at Chub's doorstep and stays does he feel the urge to love and write again.  However, she sought him out because another man told her he was ""Charley Fuller"" the writer of Under the Weather.  Sandy falls to her death from his window while Chub is gone, and while the police seem convinced it was suicide, Chub investigates his former student, now an escaped mental patient, then the man posing as Charley Fuller.  His efforts to untangle the case make his writer's impulse run even more strongly, and he works up an outline of the story, shows it to Two-Brew and gets the cherished ""On to the next"" reaction.  Finally back on the right path, Chub seeks out The Bone, wanting to move in with her so they both can write and support each other, but upon telling his story, The Bone unconsciously lets slip a detail linking her with Sandy's murder.  Chub, terrified, can only repeat to himself that this is excellent material.  He just has to live long enough to know how to use it.
